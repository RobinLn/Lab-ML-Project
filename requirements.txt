## Key Steps & Visualizations

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values, duplicates, negative numbers, and decimal typos  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis** – Distribution of lab measurements

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Scaling numeric columns using StandardScaler  
- Created ratios and interaction features  
- Selected important features with Random Forest  

### 4. Machine Learning
- **Models Trained:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  

**Feature Importance (Random Forest):**
